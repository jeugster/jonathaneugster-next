# Next Portfolio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dca552e4-6cf5-457d-842e-8f5271b27e0c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/infallible-wing-a98fca/deploys)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project hosted on Netlify, Mongodb Atlas, and Strapi on Heroku. Styling for React is Tailwind. No bills on free tier which should be sufficient for most folks who need a portfolio online and want to show off Jamstack skills.!

Site is entirely static, open-source, and source controlled. The stack allows non-technical team members to utilize tools they already know, like a CMS, or Google Tags, while maintaining developer flexibility.

Analytics tags are controlled through Google Tag Manager.

Site works well across devices and browser versions with resilience and performance.

Updates to Strapi data triggers generation of static files for new and updated pages.
