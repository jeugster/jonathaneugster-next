This [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) personal portfolio site is hosted on Netlify, Mongodb Atlas, and Strapi on Heroku. Style is handled by Tailwind CSS. Servers are micro on free tier which should be sufficient for most folks or small businesses. Scaling up is also inexpensive: simply upgrade control plane compute.

Site is entirely static, open-source, and source controlled. 

The stack allows non-technical team members to utilize tools they already know, like a CMS, or Google Tags, while allowing developers to alter any aspect of the application.

Site is responsive and works well across devices/browsers with resilience and performance.

Updates to Strapi data triggers generation of static files for new and updated components.

Marketing tags are controlled through Google Tag Manager.

Performance audits using Lighthouse.

Analytics by Google Analytics.
